# dr-abhishek-tiwari — GitHub Pages version

This repository contains a simple, accessible tabbed website version of the original Google Sites page (mirrored content).

## Files
- `index.html` — main site (About, Research, Publications, Teaching, Contact)
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — accessible tab behavior + hash routing
- `assets/` — place for PDFs, images, etc.

## How to deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repository named `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io` (replace YOUR_USERNAME).
2. Upload these files to the repository root (or use `/docs`).
3. In the repo Settings → Pages, choose branch `main` and folder `/ (root)`.
4. After a minute, the site will be available at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`.

## Notes
- Replace placeholder links and email in `index.html` with actual URLs.
- Put PDFs and images inside the `assets/` folder and reference them from the HTML.
- To embed this site in Google Sites, use the Embed → URL option with `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`.
