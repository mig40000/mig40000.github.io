# Site (links-based) for Dr. Abhishek Tiwari

This package contains a GitHub Pages-ready site where profile photo and paper links point to the original publicly hosted URLs (Google Drive, arXiv, conference pages).

Files:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js

Notes:
- PDFs and the profile photo are linked to their public URLs rather than being bundled locally. If you want PDFs bundled in the ZIP (to be hosted locally on GitHub Pages), upload them here in the chat or provide the public PDF URLs and I will fetch and bundle them.
- To deploy: create repo `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`, add these files, and enable GitHub Pages.
